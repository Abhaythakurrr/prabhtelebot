# 🔄 API Retry System - COMPLETE!

## ❌ Problem
APIs were failing with 401 errors due to:
- Single concurrency limits
- Rate limiting
- API key issues
- No retry logic

**User Experience:**
```
User: *clicks generate image*
Bot: "❌ API error: 401"
User: 😞 (frustrated)
```

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Automatic Retry System
- **3 retry attempts** for each request
- **Exponential backoff** (2s, 4s, 6s delays)
- **Automatic API key rotation**
- **Smart error handling**

### 2. API Key Rotation
- Tries `BYTEZ_API_KEY_1` first
- Falls back to `BYTEZ_API_KEY_2` on failure
- Rotates on 401 errors
- Maximizes success rate

### 3. Rate Limit Handling
- Detects 429 (rate limit) errors
- Implements wait-and-retry
- Queue management
- User-friendly messages

### 4. Better Error Messages
Instead of technical errors, users see:
- **401:** "API being configured, try in few minutes"
- **429:** "Service busy, request queued"
- **Timeout:** "Taking longer, please wait"
- Clear instructions

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Retry Loop
```python
max_retries = 3
retry_delay = 2  # seconds

for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        # Try API call
        response = requests.post(url, ...)
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return success
        
        elif response.status_code == 401:
            # Rotate API key and retry
            api_key = alternate_key
            time.sleep(retry_delay)
            continue
        
        elif response.status_code == 429:
            # Rate limit - wait longer
            wait_time = retry_delay * (attempt + 1)
            time.sleep(wait_time)
            continue
        
    except Timeout:
        # Retry on timeout
        time.sleep(retry_delay)
        continue
```

### API Key Rotation
```python
api_keys = [
    config.bytez_api_key_1,
    config.bytez_api_key_2
]

# Rotate through keys on each attempt
api_key = api_keys[attempt % len(api_keys)]
```

### Error Handling
```python
if "401" in error:
    message = "API being configured, try in few minutes"
elif "429" in error:
    message = "Service busy, request queued"
elif "timeout" in error:
    message = "Taking longer, please wait"
else:
    message = "Please try again"
```

## 📊 How It Works

### Successful Generation
```
Attempt 1: Call API with KEY_1
    ↓
Status: 200 OK
    ↓
✅ Image generated!
```

### Failed with Retry
```
Attempt 1: Call API with KEY_1
    ↓
Status: 401 Unauthorized
    ↓
Wait 2 seconds
    ↓
Attempt 2: Call API with KEY_2
    ↓
Status: 200 OK
    ↓
✅ Image generated!
```

### Rate Limited
```
Attempt 1: Call API
    ↓
Status: 429 Rate Limit
    ↓
Wait 2 seconds
    ↓
Attempt 2: Call API
    ↓
Status: 429 Rate Limit
    ↓
Wait 4 seconds
    ↓
Attempt 3: Call API
    ↓
Status: 200 OK
    ↓
✅ Image generated!
```
