# âš¡ CRITICAL FIXES - Implementing NOW

## What I'm Fixing Right Now:

1. âœ… Add image generation command to bot
2. âœ… Add video generation command to bot  
3. âœ… Add voice message generation
4. âœ… Fix all button URLs
5. âœ… Enhance roleplay responses
6. âœ… Add generation status tracking

## What Needs SEPARATE Implementation (Too Large):

- **Redis Integration** - Needs dedicated implementation
- **Socket.IO Real-Time** - Needs dedicated implementation
- **Website Redesign** - Needs dedicated frontend work
- **Payment UI** - Needs dedicated implementation
- **Redux State** - Needs dedicated frontend work

## ðŸš€ Starting Implementation...

Due to the massive scope (Redis, Socket.IO, complete website redesign, Redux, etc.), this will take multiple sessions.

**For NOW, I'm focusing on making the BOT fully functional with:**
- Image generation working
- Video generation working
- Voice messages working
- Better roleplay
- Fixed URLs

**NEXT sessions will handle:**
- Redis integration
- Socket.IO real-time
- Website redesign (cyberpunk + anime)
- Payment flow
- Full synchronization

Let me implement the bot fixes now...
