# 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

## Issues Fixed

### 🔴 ISSUE 1: Payment Button Not Working
**Problem:** Clicking payment buttons on website did nothing - no payment modal appeared

**Root Cause:** Missing API endpoints in `website/app.py`
- `/api/create-order` endpoint was missing
- `/api/verify-payment` endpoint was missing
- Frontend JavaScript was calling non-existent endpoints

**Solution Applied:**
✅ Added complete Razorpay integration to `website/app.py`:

```python
@app.route('/api/create-order', methods=['POST'])
def create_order():
    """Create Razorpay order"""
    # Creates order with Razorpay
    # Returns order_id, amount, key_id for frontend

@app.route('/api/verify-payment', methods=['POST'])
def verify_payment():
    """Verify Razorpay payment"""
    # Verifies payment signature
    # Activates user subscription
    # Returns success/failure

@app.route('/api/subscription-status/<user_id>', methods=['GET'])
def subscription_status(user_id):
    """Get user subscription status"""
    # Returns current plan, features, expiry

@app.route('/webhook/razorpay', methods=['POST'])
def razorpay_webhook():
    """Handle Razorpay webhooks"""
    # Handles payment.captured, payment.failed events

@app.route('/payment-success')
def payment_success():
    """Payment success page"""
    # Beautiful success page with next steps
```

**Files Modified:**
- `website/app.py` - Added 5 new payment endpoints

### 🔴 ISSUE 2: Image Generation Failing
**Problem:** `/generate` command failing with error: "Model returned invalid format. Try a different model."

**Root Cause:** 
- Some Bytez models return non-JSON output
- Current model selection was using models that don't work reliably
- No fallback mechanism when model fails

**Solution Applied:**
✅ Multiple fixes in `src/generation/content_generator.py`:

1. **Changed Default Model:**
```python
# OLD: Using dreamlike-photoreal (unreliable)
"model": self.config.bytez_models["image_dreamlike_photoreal"]

# NEW: Using FLUX.1-schnell (most reliable)
"model": "black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell"
```

2. **Added Automatic Fallback:**
```python
except json.JSONDecodeError as je:
    if attempt < max_retries - 1:
        logger.info(f"⏳ Switching to FLUX.1-schnell (most reliable)...")
        model_info["model"] = "black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell"
        time.sleep(retry_delay)
        continue
```

3. **Better Error Messages:**
```python
# OLD: "Model returned invalid format. Try a different model."
# NEW: "Generation failed. Please try again or use /generate command."
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/generation/content_generator.py` - Updated model selection and error handling
