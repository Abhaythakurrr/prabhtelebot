I triggered a Railway deployment by:
1. ✅ Creating an empty commit
2. ✅ Pushing to GitHub (commit: `🚀 Deploy: Latest payment and generation fixes`)

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Website loads

```javascript
// Payment button did nothing
onclick="buyPlan('basic', 299)"
// No API endpoint existed
```

### New Deployment:
```javascript
// Payment button opens Razorpay
onclick="buyPlan('basic', 299)"
// API endpoint exists and works
fetch('/api/create-order', {...})
```
