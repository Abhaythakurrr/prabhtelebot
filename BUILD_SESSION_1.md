# 🔨 BUILD SESSION 1 - Foundation

## What I'm Building Now:

This is a **multi-session project**. In this session, I'll build the foundation that everything else depends on.

### Session 1 Goals (Next 2 hours):
1. ✅ Core infrastructure
2. ✅ Model registry with all 35 models
3. ✅ Rate limiting with Redis
4. ✅ Basic AI generator
5. ✅ Basic bot handler

### Why Multi-Session:
- Total scope: 8-10 hours
- Token limits: Can't build everything in one go
- Need testing between phases
- Iterative development is better

### After Session 1:
You'll have:
- ✅ Working foundation
- ✅ Basic generation working
- ✅ Bot responding
- ⏳ Ready to add more features

### Future Sessions:
- Session 2: Complete all 35 models
- Session 3: Story injection + memory
- Session 4: Website redesign
- Session 5: Testing + deployment
